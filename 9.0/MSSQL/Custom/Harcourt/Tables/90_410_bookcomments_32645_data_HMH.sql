Lopez does a wonderful job depicting the pre-World War II art world, in which American millionaires like Andrew Mellon proved particularly easy pickings. He also gives a vivid depiction of the crafty and corrupt van Meegeren, a well-rounded portrait depicting his absolute shallowness.&quot;--Brooklyn Rail</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;Somehow author Jonathan Lopez manages to pull off an intriguing literary feat; his new book is a compelling portrait of master art forger and Nazi sympathizer Han Van Meegeren.... Lopez brilliantly explains to us his theory regarding Meegeren&#39;s extraordinary success.&quot;--Jerusalem Post</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;[Lopez] has added a good deal to our understanding of the story.--The New York Review of Books</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;Profoundly researched, focussed, absorbing...

His pioneering research on van Meegeren&#39;s early life gives us further insight into what motivates deception, a subject that will never cease to fascinate as long as art is bought and sold.&quot;--ArtNews</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;Artist and journalist Jonathan Lopez delved deeper into primary sources than Dolnick did, and has therefore produced a subtler, more nuanced account that adds significant detail to the story... this book adds much to our understanding of how [Van Meegeren] succeeded in his crimes and of how wrong and evil ideas can corrupt art and artists.&quot;--Art &amp; Antiques</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;I can say with authority that Jonathan Lopez&#39; The Man Who Made Vermeers makes for a terrific read, even by flashlight as you lay on top of sweat-soaked sheets wishing you&#39;d thought to buy a battery-operated fan before Ike struck.&quot;--Houston Chronicle&#39;s &quot;Arts in Houston&quot; column</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;[An] astonishing tale.&quot;--Harvard Magazine</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;It&#39;s hard to imagine improving on Lopez&#39;s gem of a tale.&quot;--Los Angeles Times Culture Monster blog</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;In this suspenseful, vividly written account, Lopez exposes Van Meegeren as a &#39;talented Mr. Ripley&#39; armed with a paintbrush, and casts light on illicit art-world commerce, wartime collaboration, and pure, evil genius.&quot;--Art Daily</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;Terrific and engaging.&quot;--January Magazine</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;[A] detailed and thoughtful work.&quot;--Chicago Tribune</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;[A] thoughtful and elegantly written account... Mr. Lopez is steeped in the literature of the period and it shows to fine effect.&quot;--New York Sun</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;A journey superbly etched... An absorbing history.&quot;--Salon</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;Art historian Jonathan Lopez has now raised the bar for any future books on the forger with &quot;The Man Who Made Vermeers.&quot;--Washington Times</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;First-rate research and narrative skill propel this tale of greed, war and skillful manipulation of the popular imagination.&quot;--Kirkus</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;The author gives a vivid portrait of the 1920s Hague, a stylish place of &quot;mischief and artifice&quot; where van Meegeren learned his trade, and brilliantly examines the influence of Nazi Volksgeist imagery on van Meegeren&#39;s The Supper at Emmaus , part of his forged biblical Vermeer series. Lopez&#39;s writing is witty, crisp and vigorous, his research scrupulous and his pacing dynamic.&quot;--Publishers Weekly</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;From the outrageous swindles he perpetrated in Vermeer&#39;s name to the nefarious dealings he had with the Nazis in occupied Holland, Han van Meegeren&#39;s is an unforgettable, almost unbelievable story. Witty, erudite, and utterly compelling, Jonathan Lopez&#39;s account of the twentieth century&#39;s most notorious art forger is a must-read--a book that makes van Meegeren&#39;s fake Vermeers even more fascinating, I dare say, than the Delft master&#39;s originals.&quot; ---Caroline Weber, author of QUEEN OF FASHION: WHAT MARIE ANTOINETTE WORE TO THE REVOLUTION</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&quot;Jonathan Lopez&#39;s remarkable book is at once a thrilling detective story and a meticulously researched study in art and social history. We learn not only how - but also why - Van Meegeren came to paint the forgeries that became sensations on the international art market between the wars.&quot; - Walter Liedtke, Curator of European Paintings, Metropolitan Museum of Art</div>'
