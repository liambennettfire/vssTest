  <b>How it Works:</b><br/>
  Using a special version of the Title Management Module<sup>TM</sup> from our parent,
  Firebrand Technologies, an <b><i>eloquence</i></b> publisher can manage and organize
  all the titles for a given season or list. Each title can be classified by subject
  category, target markets, sales divisions, etc. The publisher can even provide full
  jacket text, author bio''s, review citations and all other important marketing information.
  The Title Management Module<sup>TM</sup> also helps the publisher create printed
  sales catalogs, website catalogs, TIP sheets, title information sheets, pub schedules,
  and more!
  <br />
  <br/>
  When ready to release catalogs to their customers, publishers simply click a button
  in the Title Management Module<sup>TM</sup>, and download the full catalog (via
  FTP) to the <b><i>eloquence</i></b> database.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>We take care of the rest!</b><br/>
  <b><i>eloquence</i></b> ships this information electronically to all the trading
  partners identified by the publisher. We use and support the industry standards
  created by BISAC, but publishers don''t need to worry about that.... we work that
  out with your customers for you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>This is just the first Step!</b><br/>
  This model is designed to be scalable to solve other nagging book industry problems
  related to e-commerce and supply chain management. Within the next year, look for
  announcements about services related to content management and archiving, rights
  and permissions, and publisher-supplier communications.</div>
